        If you ask Brianna Castro about her journey into music, she’ll liken it
        to a serendipitous <br> string of good fortune. The 27-year-old North
        Philadelphia native didn’t plan her path <br> to becoming the
        singer-songwriter she is today, but everything about the journey felt
        right <br> as it fell into place. <br />
        <br>
        While she has always loved singing from youth, Brianna was the outlier
        when it came to <br> musical inclinations within her family. No one else
        seemed to be into the things she was: <br> basketball, running track, and
        music. She slowly honed into the latter by playing in the <br> school band
        and singing in the church choir, which ultimately gave her a nudge
        towards <br> her performance destiny. In choir she used to shine during her
        solos, and would get all <br> the due praise because of it. “I knew I had it
        a little bit when I was getting the solos and <br> they were like, oh shit,
        you sound good on this,” she says. The songwriting came at age <br> 15.
        Brianna was already good at classes like English and creative writing.
        Once it clicked <br> that she could put words to melodies, she was hooked.
        Songwriting, she says, is the best <br> way to express exactly what she’s
        feeling, and how she’s feeling it. <br>
        <br>
         From there, Brianna tuned her voice
        to the sounds of Stevie Wonder and Lauryn Hill <br> religiously—“MTV
        Unplugged is the reason why I bought an acoustic guitar,” she <br> says—and
        tapped into the woozy grit of her voice by casually listening to Tupac,
        and <br> other rap artists her older brothers would play. The result (in
        addition to handiwork from <br> Andrew “Pop” Wansel, the key producer who
        helped her find her way to Interscope) is <br>what listeners today have
        heard on the backing vocals of Tory Lanez’s “Question Is” and <br> her own
        “Handsome”: what she considers an R&B, soul and hip-hop fusion. Castro <br>
        makes music for any space—around the house, at a barbecue—and listeners
        from Gen X, <br> Y and Z can all appreciate her elastic subject matter. Aside
        from the occasional number <br> about trifling lovers, her songs run the
        gamut of real life human experiences: sometimes <br> her own, sometimes not. <br>
        <br>
        Now, after putting in work on Philly stages and in the studio, Brianna
        has a singular goal <br> with her forthcoming music: to be unforgettable.
        “People go back to their [favorite <br> artist’s] first album for
        everything,” she says. “I want my first album to be like, Oh shit, she <br>
        came out the gate with some fire. A REAL classic. Gotta set the bar for
        myself to do <br> better.”
